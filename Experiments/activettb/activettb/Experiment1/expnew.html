     <p>We would like to invite you to participate in this research project. You should only participate if you want to; choosing not to take part will not disadvantage you in any way. Before you decide whether you want to take part, it is important for you to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or you would like more information.</p>
     <p>We are investigating how people learn in new environments. In this study you will perform a simple computer task called <font color="green"><b>"Alien Olympics".</b></font> You will choose a pair of Aliens to fight against each other and learn about their strengths. The goal is to learn to predict which Alien is more likely to win in a fight.</p>
     <p>The study should not take longer than 20 minutes. Upon completion of the study, you will be paid a basic fee of $ 0.3 and an additional bonus between 0 and $ 0.5 depending on your performance. In order to qualify for the credit and bonus you need to finish the study.</p>
     All data will be handled according to the Data Protection Act 1998. All responses are treated as confidential and anonymous. All data will be pooled and published in aggregate form only. It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you choose not to participate it will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time and without providing a reason.</p>

   <p><b>Please read the following instructions very carefully: </b></p>
   <br>
   <p> Welcome to the <font color="green" FACE="bookman">ALIEN OLYMPICS</font>. The Alien Olympics are an inter-galactic event in which different Aliens compete against each other. You are chosen as a scout for this event and you will learn what it is that makes an Alien win a competition.</p>
   <p>On each trial you will have a choice of 4 different Aliens with different features: a) Antennas, b) Wings, c) Camouflage d) Diamonds. Note that the different characteristics are of different importance for an Aliens' chances of winning a competition. </p>
   It will be your task to choose <b>2 out of the 4 Aliens</b> to compete with each other. You should choose the 2 Aliens such that you can learn as much as possible about the importance of their characteristics for their strength.
   That means you should choose your Aliens wisely by selecting informative comparisons out of the 4 presented Aliens.  
	You are supposed to figure out which features are more useful than others, because later in the experiment you will need this feature knowledge in order to correctly answer some questions.
   <p><br>
	<p><b>STRUCTURE OF THE EXPERIMENT</b> <br>
	<p>1. Learning Task: You always select 2 Aliens out of 4 to fight against each other. This initial learning phase consists of 30 trials.  
	<p>2. Assessment Task: You will be presented with 2 different Aliens. These are the candidates for your Olympic team. Having learned which characteristics make an Alien strong, it will be your task to always select the Alien you consider to be stronger in your Olympic team.
   This final phase will consist of 12 choices, and your overall payment will be based on the number of times you made the correct choice.</p>

  <p><b>I.</b> Below you see 4 different Aliens. The Aliens are described by 4 different characteristics. These characteristics influence how strong they are.</p>
  <p><b>II.</b> It is your task to learn how the different characteristics influence an Alien's strength by always choosing two Aliens to compete against each other. You therefore have to make this choice wisely/informatively, i.e. by creating comparisons with an outcome that tells you something about the effect of the different characteristics.</p>
  <p><b>III.</b> Once you click on an Alien it will be marked by a black rectangle.</p>
  <p><b>IV.</b> After you have chosen two Aliens, please press the "Compete"-Button and you will see which of the two Aliens has won the competition. You cannot choose more or less than 2 Aliens for a competition.</p>
  <p><b>V.</b> Remember that just as in any sport, sometimes a weaker Alien can win against a stronger. This can happen. Nevertheless you should try to find out which factors influence whether an Alien lost or won and how strong these effects are.</p>
  <p><b>VI.</b> After each competition, you have to click "Next trial" to continue.</p>
